Much of the argumentation in the book is spurious, and the argumentation that's at least correct is really not impressive because it's basically always given to counter an argument that's so obviously dumb it wasn't worth the ink to refute it. <br/><br/>Best bit: being offered a shitload of jumping off-points for further reading, because the author name-drops so much.<br/>Worst bit: The author's embarrassingly dumb argument against environmental damage from population growth.
