On August 15th in Gowanus, Brooklyn I gave a talk at [NYC Systems](https://nycsystems.xyz/august-2024.html) on some of the
container runtime stuff I've worked on at Modal in the past two years.

NYC Systems is a delightfully 'in the weeds' kind of meetup and I enjoyed the challenge of presenting to such a knowledgable
bunch of people. The kind of systems work explored in the talk is exactly what I was seeking when I moved to work at a cloud
infra company.

If this stuff is equally as interesting to you, we're of course [hiring at Modal](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/modal) :)

If you're after a higher level look at the _what and why_ of Modal, Erik Bernhardsson, the CEO, [gave at Data Council talk last year](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/creating-our-own-kubernetes-and-docker-to-run-our-data-infrastructure).
