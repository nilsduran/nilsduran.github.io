I love the _Blade Runner_ movies — seeing BR 2049 in IMAX is possibly my favorite cinema experience of the 2010s.
Going into this, I expected to read the original Blade Runner plot but told in a different medium and with extra detail.
Although Deckard is still killing the same set of replicants (Zhora, Leon, Pris, Roy) the focus of this book is in a completely
different place, and it manages to be fully its own thing even to a reader who has watched and rewatched the film adaptions.

In _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ you'll be treated to multiple scenes of dystopian domesticity, a much more interesting treatment
of the 'synthetic pet animals' idea, and a strange religion called Mercerism that could merit its own novel but is in this potent novel just
a sideshow.
