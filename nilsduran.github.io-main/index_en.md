# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, <br/> I'm Nils Duran.

### I'm an AI developer with a passion for machine learning and data science.

### Currently, I'm studying Artificial Intelligence at UPC, Barcelona.

<br>

I can usually be found in a programming IDE or reading.
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

- ðŸ§  Artificial Intelligence and its potential to solve real-world problems.
- ðŸ“š Good old-fashioned books. Two recent favourites are [_Atomic Habits_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits) and [_Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens).
- ðŸ§— Climbing, Tennis, and Chess.
