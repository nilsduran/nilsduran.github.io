# My Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on.

## Predicting Chess Puzzle Elo Rating
Predicted the Elo rating difficulty of a chess position leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Took advantage of existing game engines like Stockfish, Leela, and Maia to improve performance.

## Image Classification with MareNostrum 5
Trained several Transformer-based models on the full MAMe dataset (>200 GB) and achieved 0.75 f1-score. Used the MareNostrum V supercomputer and Slurm to train the models on a very large dataset.

## Cirrhosis Patient Status Classification
Worked with health data to classify the status of patients with cirrhosis. Trained several models including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Explainable Boosting Machine.

## Solving Atari Games with DQN
Worked with the Gymnasium library to create environments and implement several Reinforcement Learning algorithms such as DQN, DDPG, TD3, SAC, and PPO.
